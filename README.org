* A Package to Render Org to Hexo's Markdown

Just for users who are perflexed by that Hexo can't render Org directly.

** Installation

You can install =jk-org2md-hexo= using melpa, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  M-x package-install jk-org2md-hexo
#+END_SRC

and if you use =use-package= manage your configurations, this way is okay:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package jk-org2md-hexo
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

This package is used to render a =.org= file to a =.md= file which can be rendered by HEXO.

It offers two useful functions, and you must execute them in order, like this:

*** jk/insert-date

It will be insert a time string like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+DATE: 2019/02/19 12:29:08
#+END_EXAMPLE

It must be executed before =jk/md-export=. 

*** jk/md-export

It must be executed after =jk/insert-date=. 

It will be insert a front-matter in a generated =.md= file, like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ---
  title: get things done  
  date: 2018/06/09 12:46:29
  updated: 2019/02/10 12:46:52
  ---
  ...
  ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Summary

1. Make sure that in a =.org= buffer, such as =xx/_orgs/hello-world.org=, then
2. execute =jk/insert-date= , like =M-x jk/insert-date=, then
3. execute =jk/md-export=

Now, here will be a =.md= file, such as =xx/_posts/hello-world.md=.

If you update the =.org= file again, just run =jk/md-export= to update the relative =.md= file.
